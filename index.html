<title>Park Like a Neighbor, not a Cunt!</title>

  <h1>So, You Parked Like a Cunt</h1>
  <a>Hi! You're probably seeing this page because you parked like a cunt and got a card notifying you of aforementioned cuntiness. I know that nobody likes being called a cunt, but I hope that this website is able to help you see why your behaviour could be perceived as "cunty" by some.</a>
  <h2>What Did I Do That Was Cunty?</h2>
  <a>Typically I hand these cards out to people who have parked across the sidewalks. When you park on the sidewalk, this impedes pedestrians just because you felt like storing your car in a public space. This is very inconsiderate of your neighbors, and if you simply park on the street or even sometimes just pull all the way forward, you'll look much less like a selfish prick to your neighbors, which I think you and most people tend to want.</a>
  <h2>I'm Not Hurting Anyone, Can You Stop Being Such a Karen?</h2>
  <a>I know it might not seem like a big deal, but we have people in our community that span the entire gammut of ability. Many of these people depend on sidewalks as their mode of transportation, and by parking over the sidewalk, you impede their ability to get around! Imagine if someone double-parked your car—You'd be rightfully a bit pissed and you might think that person is a cunt for doing so. Well, that's what the rest of us think when you park the way you did, so be a good neighbor and make sure you're parking in a manner that is respectful to all the people in your community.</a>
  <h2>I Was Just In A Rush—I'm Not The Kind Of Person Who Parks Like a Cunt</h2>
  <a>It might be true that you were just in a rush, or that it was just this once, but the fact that you got this card means you parked like a cunt in at least one instance and you did a disservice to your neighbors and your community. That makes you the kind of person who parks like a cunt, even if it was only once or temporarily. Never fear, however, as you can change! All you have to do is own up to your mistake and start parking less like a cunt—By doing so, you'll be actively making your community a better place to live. How cool is that?!</a>
