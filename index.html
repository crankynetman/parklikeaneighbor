<title>Park Like a Neighbor, not a Cunt!</title>

  <h1>So, You Parked Like a Cunt</h1>
  <a>Hi! You're probably seeing this page because you parked like a cunt and got a card notifying you of aforementioned cuntiness. I know that nobody likes being called a cunt, but I hope that this website is able to help you see why your behaviour could be perceived as "cunty" by some.</a>
  <h2>What Did I Do That Was Cunty?</h2>
  <a>Typically I hand these cards out to people who have parked across the sidewalks. When you park on the sidewalk, this impedes pedestrians just because you felt like storing your car in a public space. This is very inconsiderate of your neighbors, and if you simply park on the street or even sometimes just pull all the way forward, you'll look much less like a selfish prick to your neighbors, which I think you and most people tend to want.</a>
